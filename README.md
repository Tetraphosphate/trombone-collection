# trombone-collection
A fun side project of mine. Collect different trombones and maintain them I guess. I'll be working on this when I don't have schoolwork to do.

## Types of trombones I'm making sprites of right now:
- Jupiter 1242RL-T XO professional bass trombone
- Yamaha YSL-154 student tenor trombone

## What I'm currently working on:
- Making a trombone sprite template
- Colour pallete?
- Getting code up and running

US law says that creative works are copyrighted by default even if the creator did not register a copyright. I don't have the money to register a copyright (heck, I don't even have a credit card) so yeah. Everything here Â© Janice C.
